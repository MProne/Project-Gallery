        <h1>Light Sword</h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mar 2022 - Jun 2022</h2>
        <p class="desc_text">This light sword is based off of the Zedd Sword from the video game Valorant. It features LEDs that can change colors to make the blade appear as if its made of light. The gold moon knob on the sword is used to change the color of the blade. This project was built for my grade 8 capstone assignment which represents aspects of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math. </p>

        <h1>Infinity light cube</h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">May 1 2022 - May 28 2022</h2>
        <p class="desc_text">This is an infinity cube which utilizes the science of how one way mirrors react with light to produce an endless illusion. Since each individual light can be its own color, I was able to program some interesting effects like a dot of light chassing itself in the cube. One of the biggest challenges of this project was the soldering. Having to solder tiny wires to the LED strips in awkward positions really tested my soldering ability.</p>

        <h1>CNC Laser Engraver</h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Sept 2022 - Nov 2022</h2>
        <p class="desc_text">Here we have a laser engraving machine that can burn simple shapes into wood. Although I never finished this project, I still made impressive progress. This project challenged me in many aspects from modeling the right parts for the electronics, to applying the right math required to draw certain shapes. Currently, it can only draw lines, my original plan was to have it draw complex shapes like circles or parabolas, but my math skills in Grade 9 weren't good enough.</p>

        <h1>Swerve Drive Robot</h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mar 2023 - Jul 2023</h2>
        <p class="desc_text">The purpose of this project was to replicate the omni-directional drivetrain system known as "Swerve Drive". Alternatively in an automotive context, its also known as a "Crab driving" system. Each wheel on this robot can pivot like a shopping cart wheel while also drive at the same time which results in some mesmerizing movements. The wheel mechanisms have gone through 5 different revisions with each revision becoming more refined and reliable.</p>

        <h1>Manual Transmission</h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Dec 2024 - Jul 2025</h2>
        <p class="desc_text">Mainly my specialties are related to electronics and programming, not mechanical. With this project, I wanted to take a risk and try making something heavily mechanical related. What I ended up making is a 6 speed manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch, mechanisms that can be found inside manual drive vehicles. I also realized I needed to make a tachometer and pedals to test the functionality of my transmission.</p>
